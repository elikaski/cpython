Playing Around With Python
=============================================
This is a fork of the official `CPython project <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_.



Plusplus Branch
---------------

The good old fashioned Python, now with the ++ operator!

Supports both pre-increment and post-increment.

Can be used anywhere!

Because I was not convinced by this answer.

How to run
^^^^^^^^^^

In order to run the interpreter simply run python.exe.

If copied elsewhere, it requires to have python313.dll and the Lib directory in the same directory as python.exe.

To make changes and compile, refer to the original `CPython project <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_.
