How to run
^^^^^^^^^^

In order to run the interpreter simply run python.exe.

If copied elsewhere, it requires to have python313.dll and the Lib directory in the same directory as python.exe.

To make changes and compile, refer to the original `CPython project <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_.
